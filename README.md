### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’¬ Here is who I am: thanks to my great appetite for learning, I oriented myself in a self-taught way towards IT support into my company, solving bugs for the payroll consultants, developing customer projects and new features to ease the daily work of my colleagues.
This aspect made me want to go further in this field, to learn new computer languages, and to acquire ever more skills.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning **Javascript** at the Wild Code School of Biarritz, but also many concepts, languages, tools related to JS (**typescript, react, nextJS, nodeJS, prisma and others...**)
But I already know I won't stop here and keep learning always more.

ðŸ‘¯ If someone come by here and want to give a chance to a newbie full of hope, notice that I have to make an **internship from february the 12th to end of march 2023**.
I'll be delighted to show my motivation and my quick learning skill.

Thanks for coming and have a nice day  :upside_down_face:
